JobRunner Version: 1.3.0


'JobRunner' is a tool designed to 'run' a 'job', ie to execute a command line or script 
that does not require user interaction, and take care of storing the program's output 
(standard error and standard out) in an easy to read log file. The tool is able to save 
"configuration files" (or "job description") of the job to be run.

'JobRunner_Caller' is a tool designed to 'call' JobRunner's "configuration files", acting as a 
"queue processor".

The tools were designed to work using directory lock mechanism instead of relying on a central 
networked server to dispatch jobs and aggregate log and job status information from networked clients.


INSTALLATION
------------

The tool does not need to be installed as it can be called from anywhere and as long as the files
in the archive are together, it will work.

There is no installation mechanism for the tool, as it is a standalone tool and has only one internal 
depencies to a perl package (JRHelper.pm) containing a set of functions used by both tools.
Its Perl packages dependencies are only some core modules.

If you desire to make them available in your PATH, keep the files in their uncompression location 
(where both executables and the perl package are located), and make symbolic links to the original 
perl executables, namely:

- with <uncompress_path> the location of both executables and the perl package
- with <install_path> a location that is part of your PATH

% cd <install_path>
% ln -s <uncompress_path>/JobRunner.pl JobRunner
% ln -s <uncompress_path>/JobRunner_Caller.pl JobRunner_Caller

Remember not to remove the uncompressed version of the tools.
