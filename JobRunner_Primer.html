<h2>Description</h2>

<b>JobRunner</b> is a tool designed to <i>run</i> a <i>job</i>, ie to
execute a command line or script that does not require user
interaction, and takes care of storing the
program's output (standard error and standard out) in an easy to read
log file. The tool is able to save <i>configuration files</i> (or
"<i>job description</i>") of the <i>job</i> to be run.<br>
<br>
<b>JobRunner_Caller</b> is a tool designed to <i>call</i>
<b>JobRunner</b>'s <i>configuration files</i>, acting as a <i>queue
processor</i>.<br>
<br>
The tools were designed to work using directory lock mechanism instead
of relying on a central networked server to dispatch jobs and aggregate
log and job status information from networked clients.

<a name="JobRunner">
<h2>JobRunner</h2>
</a>

<h3>Command line options</h3>

<pre>
JobRunner [options] --lockdir ldir --name jobid --executable script
  or
JobRunner [options] --lockdir ldir --name jobid -- command_line_to_run

if it can be run, will either run the executable script or the command_line_to_run 



Where [options] are split in:
  required_options [common_options] [step1_options] [step2_options] [step3_options]


required_options are:
  --lockdir ldir
      base lock directory, used to create the actual lock directory (default location of the logfile)
  --name jobid
      the unique ID (text value) representing one's job (fixed so that it remove any leading and trailing space, and transforming any characters not a-z, 0-9 or - to _)
  --executable script
      executable file to run (only required in non 'command_line_to_run' mode)


[common_options] apply to any step, and are:
  --help
      This help message. For more help and examples, please look at the Primer that should have been included in the source archive of the tool
  --version
      Version information
  --Verbose
      Print more verbose status updates
  --mutexTool tool
      Specify the full path location of a special locking tool used to create a mutual exclusion to insure JobID exclusive execution (**). Can be specified globaly using the 'JOBRUNNER_MUTEXTOOL' environment variable (command line takes precedence)
  --MutexLockDir dir
      Directory in which the 'mutexTool' lock for JobID will be created. Can be specified globaly using the 'JOBRUNNER_MUTEXLOCKDIR' environment variable (command line takes precedence). If none is specified, the main 'lockdir' will be used.
  --okquit
      In case the command line to run return a bad status, return the "ok" (exit code 0) status, otherwise return the actual command return code (note that this only applies to the command run, all other issues will return the error exit code)
  --SuccessReturnCode
      If the command line to run was run successfully (or previously run successfully), return the user provided error code, any other return code indicates a non successful completion (including skipping job)
  --ignoreChildSignal
      Do not exit with error if the job exited on a SIGNAL. The default is to consider any signal an error condition (ex: SIGINT) 
  --saveConfig file
      Do not run anything, instead save the command line options needed to run that specific JobRunner job into a specified configuration file that can be loaded in another JobRunner call using '--useConfig'
  --useConfig file
      Use one (and only one) JobRunner configuration files generated by '--saveConfig'. To run on multiple files, use 'JobRunner_Caller'.
  --toPrint text
    Change the default output header for JobRunner from:  followed by jobid to user given entry

[step1_options] are any options that take effect before the lock is made, and are (in order of use):
  --preCreateDir dir [--preCreateDir dir [...]] 
      Create the specified writable directory if it does not exist. Note that this is done before any checks and as such should be used with caution.
  --dirChange dir
      Go to the specified directory
  --LogFile file
      Override the default location of the log file (inside the run lock directory). Use this option with caution since it will influence the behavior of 'checkfile'
  --NameCheck jobid [--NameCheck jobid [...]]
      Check that the specified 'jobid' is completed before accepting to run this job. Will check in the same 'lockdir' as the main 'jobid'.
  --checkfile file [--checkfile file [...]]
      check that the required file is present before accepting to run this job. When a successful run is present, check if the file date is newer than the successful run's logfile to decide if a re-run is necessary.
  --RunIfTrue executable [--RunIfTrue executable [...]]
      Check that given program (no arguments accepted) returns the ok exit status (0) to run job, otherwise do not run job (will still be available for later rerun)
  --badErase
      If a bad run is present, erase its run lock directory so it can be retried
  --Onlycheck
      Do the entire check list but before doing the actual run, exit with a return code value of "99" (reminder: 1 means that there was an issue, 0 means that the program exited successfully, ie in this case a previous run completed, which can still be a bad run)


[step2_options] are any options that take effect after the lock is made but before the job is run, and are (in order of use):
  --goRunInLock
      Run in the lock directory
  --CreateDir dir [--CreateDir dir [...]]
      Create the specified writable directory if it does not exist.
  --GoRunInDir
      Run in the specified directory


[step3_options] are any options that take effect after the job is run (in order of use):
  --PostRunChangeDir dir
      Change directory to dir
  --DonePostRun script
      If the executable or run command exited successfully, run specified script
  --ErrorPostRun script
      If the executable or run command did not exit successfully, run specified script


**: this is extremely important for queues on network shares (such as NFS), specify the tool that is known to create a safe exclusive access lock file on such a network share. The tool (or wrapper script) must: 1) take only one argument, the lock file location. 2) create the lock file but not erase it (this is done by JobRunner after job completion). 3) return the 0 exit status if the lock was obtained, any other status otherwise.
</pre>

<code>mutexTool</code> Note: for our use over NFS, we have relied on the
<code>rlock</code> command (part of the ruby library called <a
href="https://github.com/ahoward/lockfile">lockfile</a>) using the
following wrapper (named <code>sp_lock.csh</code>):

<pre>
#!/bin/csh

set lfile=$1
shift

# timeout after 60 seconds if not able to obtain the lockfile
# consider any lock older than 10 days "stale" (in seconds: 3600*24*10=864000) [nil for infinite]
# when stealing a lock, only wait 10 seconds before confirming

rlock --timeout=60 --max_age 864000 --suspend 10 $lfile
</pre>

<h3>Simple Job</h3>

In its simplest form, the tool is run either as:
<pre>
JobRunner --lockdir ldir --name jobid -- commandline_to_run
</pre>
or
<pre>
JobRunner --lockdir ldir --name jobid --executable script
</pre>

The first form uses the information on the commandline as the <i>job</i>
<i>commandline_to_run</i>.
The second form uses the <i>executable</i> <code>script</code> as the <i>job</i> <i>command</i>.

<h3>Job processing</h3>

In order to understand how the tool works, one must understand its use
of <i>Lock directories</i>.

Those allow for <i>jobs</i> to only be run once and allow
the user to know the exit status of one's <i>jobs</i> by simply looking at
the directory name.
<br>
They are placed in the
<code>--lockdir</code> directory and are composed of the
<code>--name</code>'s reformatted <code>jobid</code> (any character
that is not <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>, <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>, <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> is replaced by <code>_</code>) followed by five <code>_</code> and
terminated by a <code>&lt;STATUS&gt;</code> information:
<pre>
ldir/jobid_____&lt;STATUS&gt;
</pre>
, where <code>&lt;STATUS&gt;</code> is one of:
<ul>
  <li> <code>inprogress</code>; the <i>job</i> is currently <i>in
  progress</i> but has not yet completed,
  <li> <code>done</code>; the <i>job</i> has completed and the program exited
  with an <i>ok</i> status (i.e. exited with status code 0), 
  <li> <code>bad</code>; the <i>job</i> is complete but its program exited
  with a <i>non ok</i> statys (i.e. exited with a status code
  different from 0),
  <li> <code>skip</code>; a special mode (user created dir) in which the <i>job</i> will be
  bypassed entirely.
</ul>

When a <b>JobRunner</b> command line is executed:

<ol>
  <li>If used, confirm that the <code>mutexTool</code> and <code>MutexLockDir</code> are
  proper, and obtain the mutex if able. If not, it means that somebody
  else is doing this job, and a skip is forced.
  <li>If any, do <i>job</i> pre-tasks. In order:
  <ol>
    <li>create the <code>preCreatedir</code> directory
    <li>change directory to <code>dirChange</code>
    <li>confirming that the <code>executable</code> and
    <code>RunIfTrue</code> scripts are available
    <li>check all requested <code>checkfile</code>s existence and
    bypass the <i>job</i> if any does not exist
  </ol>
  <li>Insure that the <i>job</i> is available to be run by checking its
  <i>lock directory</i>:
  <ol>
    <li>Check that a given <i>job</i> does not have multiple <i>lock directories</i>, and if
    that is the case exit in error
    <li>bypass <i>jobs</i> to be <code>skip</code>-ped
    <li>bypass completed but <code>bad</code> <i>jobs</i>, unless requested
    to rerun them (<code>badErase</code>) in which case delete the
    <code>bad</code> <i>lock directory</i>
    <li>checking if a <code>done</code>'s <i>lock directory</i> log
    file (default location is in directory, can be overriden using
    <code>LogFile</code>) is present:
    <ol>
      <li>if not, consider as a new run, and delete the <code>done</code>
      <i>lock directory</i>
      <li>if it is present and none of the requested
      <code>checkfile</code>s are more recent that the logfile, bypass
      this <i>job</i> (and return with <code>SuccessReturnCode</code>
      if used), otherwise delete the <code>done</code>
      <i>lock directory</i>
    </ol>
    <li>bypass if already <code>inprogress</code>
  </ol>
  <li>check that all <code>RunIfTrue</code> scripts exit with the
  <i>ok</i> status before accepting the <i>job</i> as runnable
  <li>if <code>Onlycheck</code> was requested, exit with requested return value 
  <li>create the <code>inprogress</code> <i>run lock directory</i>
  <li>if <code>goRunInLock</code> was selected, change directory to <i>run lock directory</i>
  <li>if any, do the pre-<i>job</i> running task: creating the
  <code>CreateDir</code> directories.
  <li> if <code>GoRunInDir</code> is selected, change to the specified
  directory.
  <li><b>run the <i>job</i></b>
  <li>if any <code>PostRunChangeDir</code> was requested go to the
  requested directory
  <li>depending on the <i>job</i> exit status:
  <ul>
    <li>for <i>ok</i> exit status (and no <i>SIGNALs</i> --unless ignored)
    <ul>
      <li>if requested, run the <code>DonePostRun</code> script (will
      only print a warning message if it did not complete with an
      <i>ok</i> status)
      <li>rename the <i>lock directory</i> from
      <code>inprogress</code> to <code>done</code>
      <li>exit with the <i>ok</i> status unless
      <code>SuccessReturnCode</code> was requested, in which case
      return with that status.
    </ul>
    <li>for <i>non ok</i> exit status (or any <i>SIGNAL</i> --if not ignored)
    <ul>
      <li>if requested, run the <code>ErrorPostRun</code> script (will
      only print a warning message if it did not complete with an
      <i>ok</i> status)
      <li>rename the <i>lock directory</i> from
      <code>inprogress</code> to <code>bad</code>
      <li>exit with the <i>non ok</i> status
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h3>A Serie of Examples</h3>
  
<h4>"Hello World !" (version 1)</h4>

After creating our <code>lockdir</code> (<code>JR_lockd</code>):
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test -- echo \"hello world \!\"
[JobRunner] test -- Job succesfully completed
</pre>

Each line containing <code>[JobRunner]</code> is an output from the tool (default value can be changed using <code>toPrint</code>), allowing us to easily distinguish between code output and <i>JobRunner</i>'s output.

<b>JobRunner</b> informs us that the <i>job</i> named
<code>test</code> is <i>succesfully completed</i>.
This is easily confirmed by confirming the expected <i>lock
directory</i>'s existence (<code>JR_lockd/test_____done</code>) that
only contains the <code>logfile</code> whose content is as follow:
<pre>
[[COMMANDLINE]] echo "Hello World !"
[[RETURN CODE]] 0
[[SIGNAL]] 0
[[STDOUT]]
Hello World !

[[STDERR]]
</pre>
In it we can see that:
<ul>
  <li>the <code>COMMANDLINE</code> ran was <code>echo "Hello World !"</code>
  <li>the <code>RETURN CODE</code> of the command line execution was
  <code>0</code>, the <i>ok</i> status
  <li>no <code>SIGNAL</code> (<code>0</code>) was used on the command line execution
  <li>the expected result of the command was printed on
  <code>STDOUT</code>
  <li>nothing was print on <code>STDERR</code>
</ul>

Note that since this was provided on the command line, it was
preferable to escape the <code>&quot;</code> and <code>!</code> to be
certain the command line ran was as expected.
<br>
If we re-run the command again we are told the the <code>test</code>
<i>job</i> was <code>Previously succesfully completed</code>.
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test -- echo \"hello world \!\"
[JobRunner] test : Previously successfully completed
</pre> 

If we change the <code>jobid</code> to <code>test2</code>:
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test2 -- echo \"Hello World \!\"
[JobRunner] test2 -- Job succesfully completed
</pre>
we are able to run the same program again, since it is a new
<code>jobid</code>, and we will now see in the <code>lockdir</code>
both the <code>test_____done</code> and <code>test2_____done</code> directories.

<h4>"Hello World !" (version 2)</h4>

After trying to run a command line through <b>JobRunner</b>, let us try
the <code>executable</code> script version, for that we create a
<code>hello_world.bash</code> file containing:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello World !"
touch hello_world_file
</pre>
and make it executable (<code>chmod +x hello_world.bash</code>).

The main difference between the first version and this version, in
addition to having what was once a command line an executable, is that
the script will in addition create a <code>hello_world_file</code>
file in the <i>current directory</i> where the executable is run.

<br>
Then we can run the program from the <i>current directory</i> (.) :
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test3 --executable ./hello_world.bash
[JobRunner] test3 : Job successfully completed
</pre>
As per previous runs, we can see that the
<code>JR_lockd/test3_____done/logfile</code> contains the expected
<code>Hello World !</code> printed in the <code>[[STDOUT]]</code>
section. And we find a <code>hello_world_file</code> in the <i>current
directory</i> (ie in <code>.</code>).
<br>
It is possible to request the script to run in a specific directory,
like <code>/tmp</code>, such as:
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test4 --executable ./hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp
[Warning] [JobRunner] test4 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[ERROR] [JobRunner] test4 : Problem with 'executable' (./hello_world.bash): file does not exist
[ERROR] 
</pre>
but as we can see the <code>./hello_world.bash</code> script was not
relative to <code>/tmp</code> and therefore is not available to be
run. To remedy this situation we have to unrelativise <code>.</code>
by using <code>pwd</code> for the <code>executable</code>
(<code>lockdir</code> is the only entries that the tool will attempt
to relativise from the starting directory) so that:
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test4 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp
[Warning] [JobRunner] test4 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test4 : Job successfully completed
</pre>
This time we find a <code>/tmp/hello_world_file</code> file.
<br>
It is also possible to request the script to run in the <i>run lock
directory</i> using the <code>goRunInLock</code> command line option, which allows for the user to not have to worry about
creating directories to store one's created files.
This method will create any new files in the
location of <i>run lock directory</i> where we expect to find the <code>logfile</code>
alone, and use it a <i>run directory</i> where data can be stored
in to the <i>current directory</i>.

<h4>"Hello World !" (version 3)</h4>

In this example, we will run the <code>hello_world.bash</code> program
but only if the required file <code>required_file</code> is
present.
<br>
First, let us see what happens when the file is not present:
<pre>
% rm -f required_file
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test5 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file
[Warning] [JobRunner] test5 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[ERROR] [JobRunner] test5 : Problem with 'checkfile' [<i>pwd_path</i>/required_file] : file does not exist
[ERROR]
</pre>
Now, let's create the file and run the tool:
<pre>
% touch required_file
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test5 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file
[Warning] [JobRunner] test5 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test5 : Job successfully completed
</pre>
as we can see, because the <code>required_file</code> file does exist,
the <code>executable</code> can be run.<br>
<br>
If we try to rerun the <b>JobRunner</b> tool:
<pre>
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test5 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file
[Warning] [JobRunner] test5 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test5 : Previously successfully completed, and no files listed in 'checkfile' is newer than the logfile, not re-runing
</pre>
, a previous <i>lock directory</i> is present and no
<code>checkfile</code> files is newer than the logfile, there is no
need to run or re-run the <i>job</i>.<br>
<br>
If we <code>touch</code> the
<code>required_file</code>, ie change its date as being more recent
than the last <b>JobRunner</b> run's <code>logfile</code> (and asking
the tool to be a little more <code>Verbose</code>):
<pre>
% touch required_file
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test5 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file --Verbose
[Warning] [JobRunner] test5 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
!! [JobRunner] test5 : Previously successfully completed, but at least one file listed in 'checkfile' is newer than the logfile => re-runing
[JobRunner] test5 : !! Deleting previous run lockdir [<i>pwd_path</i>/JR_lockd/test5_____done]
[JobRunner] test5 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test5 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test5 : Job successfully completed
</pre>
, here despite the fact that a <i>lock directory</i> was already
present, the <code>required_file</code> <code>checkfile</code> being
newer than the <code><i>pwd_path</i>/JR_lockd/test5_____done/logfile</code>,
<b>JobRunner</b> did a forced <i>re-run</i> of the <i>job</i> by
deleting the entire <i>lock directory</i>.
<br>
This behavior make it possible to have the tool check for updated
source files before accepting to run (or re-run) a job. It is also
possible to run a job only if a certain precondition is met. This is
done using the <code>--RunIfTrue</code> command line option by
checking the <i>return status code</i> of the executable run, so that
the user specific condition is met if the return code is <b>0</b> (the
unix ok exit status). For example, to only run the
<code>hello_world.bash</code> script when the five minute load is
under 1.0, we created a small script we named
<code>is5minloadok.sh</code> that relies on the <code>uptime</code>
command. The content of that script is as follow:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
RIL=1.0
L5E=`uptime | perl -ne 'print $1 if (m%load\saverage.?\:\s+([\d\.]+)%);'| perl -ne 'if ($_ < '$RIL'){print"0"}else{print"1"}'`
exit $L5E
</pre>
in which the <code>RIL</code> variable set the expected load value and
<code>L5E</code> set the <code>exit</code> by calling
<code>uptime</code>, extracting the <i>5 minutes load average</i>
information, comparing it to the <code>RIL</code> value (or
<i>1.0</i>) so that if the load is less than the value, return
<code>0</code> (ie the unix <i>ok status</i>) otherwise return
<code>1</code>.<br>
After making this <code>is5minloadok.sh</code> program executable, we
can try to run the <i>test5</i> <i>job</i> again as such:
<pre>
% touch required_file
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test5 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file --Verbose --RunIfTrue `pwd`/is5minloadok.sh
[Warning] [JobRunner] test5 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
!! [JobRunner] test5 : Previously successfully completed, but at least one file listed in 'checkfile' is newer than the logfile => re-runing
[JobRunner] test5 : !! Deleting previous run lockdir [<i>pwd_path</i>/JR_lockd/test5_____done]
[JobRunner] test5 : == 'RunIfTrue' check OK (<i>pwd_path</i>/is5minloadok.sh)
[JobRunner] test5 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test5 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test5 : Job successfully completed
</pre>
In this case, the load on my system was low enough that the <i>5 minutes
load</i> was less than 1.0, therefore the <code>RunIfTrue</code>
returned <i>ok</i> and therefore the job could be run.

<h4>"Hello World !" (version 4)</h4>

In this example, we are also making use of the
<code>DonePostRun</code> and <code>ErrorPostRun</code> options to
create status files that can be checked by outside programs to trigger
other jobs that could only be run once a previous job is completed.

<pre>
% touch required_file
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test5 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file --Verbose --RunIfTrue `pwd`/is5minloadok.sh --DonePostRun 'touch /tmp/test5_doneok' --ErrorPostRun 'touch /tmp/test5_error'
[Warning] [JobRunner] test5 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
!! [JobRunner] test5 : Previously successfully completed, but at least one file listed in 'checkfile' is newer than the logfile => re-runing
[JobRunner] test5 : !! Deleting previous run lockdir [<i>pwd_path</i>/JR_lockd/test5_____done]
[JobRunner] test5 : == 'RunIfTrue' check OK (<i>pwd_path</i>/is5minloadok.sh)
[JobRunner] test5 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test5 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test5 : %% OK Post Running: 'touch /tmp/test5_doneok'

[JobRunner] test5 : Job successfully completed
</pre>

Other examples of uses of those options:
<ul>
  <li>email user with a specific message upon job unsuccesful or
  succesful completion
  <li>delete a dataset upon completion of work on it to save disk
  space
  <li>Append a step result to a global database
</ul>

<h4>"Hello World !" (version 5)</h4>

In this example, we will run the same example as in version 4, as <i>jobid</i> <i>test6</i>, but will create a configuration file for running it at a later time:

<pre>
% touch required_file
% JobRunner --lockdir JR_lockd --name test6 --executable `pwd`/hello_world.bash --dirChange /tmp --checkfile `pwd`/required_file --Verbose --RunIfTrue `pwd`/is5minloadok.sh --DonePostRun 'touch /tmp/test6_doneok' --ErrorPostRun 'touch /tmp/test6_error' --saveConfig `pwd`/test6.jobrunner
Wrote 'saveConfig' file (<i>pwd_path</i>/test6.jobrunner)
</pre>

As can be seen, no processing was done by the tool except for the generation of the configuration file, whose content is a simple <i>array dump</i> of the command line arguments in the orders they were added on the command line:
<pre>
# Job Runner Configuration file

$VAR1 = [
          '--lockdir',
          'JR_lockd',
          '--name',
          'test6',
          '--executable',
          '<i>pwd_path</i>/hello_world.bash',
          '--dirChange',
          '/tmp',
          '--checkfile',
          '<i>pwd_path</i>/required_file',
          '--Verbose',
          '--RunIfTrue',
          '<i>pwd_path</i>/is5minloadok.sh',
          '--DonePostRun',
          'touch /tmp/test6_doneok',
          '--ErrorPostRun',
          'touch /tmp/test6_error'
        ];
</pre>

To run this configuration file, simply use the <code>useConfig</code> option:
<pre>
% JobRunner --useConfig test6.jobrunner 
[Warning] [JobRunner] test6 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test6 : == 'RunIfTrue' check OK (<i>pwd_path</i>/is5minloadok.sh)
[JobRunner] test6 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test6 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test6 : %% OK Post Running: 'touch /tmp/test6_doneok'

[JobRunner] test6 : Job successfully completed
</pre>

An interesting use of the configuration file is the creation of a default configuration file and overridding its content using new command line overrides:
<pre>
% JobRunner --useConfig test6.jobrunner --name test7
[Warning] [JobRunner] test7 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test7 : == 'RunIfTrue' check OK (<i>pwd_path</i>/is5minloadok.sh)
[JobRunner] test7 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test7 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test7 : %% OK Post Running: 'touch /tmp/test6_doneok'

[JobRunner] test7 : Job successfully completed
</pre>

Here, I just requested for the <i>name</i> to be one that was not yet run and it authorized the rerun.

Using the same idea, we can create an updated configuration file for a <i>jobid</i> <i>test8</i>:
<pre>
% JobRunner --useConfig test6.jobrunner --name test8 --saveConfig `pwd`/test8.jobrunner
Wrote 'saveConfig' file (<i>pwd_path</i>/test8.jobrunner)
</pre>

Using this method it is possible to create many similar jobs quickly, simply modifying the <code>jobid</code> and <code>excecutable</code> <i>script</i>, but using the same other configuration settings.

For example:
<pre>
% JobRunner --useConfig test6.jobrunner --name test9 --executable /bin/pwd --saveConfig `pwd`/test9.jobrunner
Wrote 'saveConfig' file (<i>pwd_path</i>/test9.jobrunner)
</pre>

contains the same content as the <code>test6.jobrunner</code> except for the two changes done on the command line, the <code>name</code> and the <code>executable</code>:

<pre>
# Job Runner Configuration file

$VAR1 = [
          '--lockdir',
          'JR_lockd',
<b>          '--name',
          'test9',
          '--executable',
          '/bin/pwd',</b>
          '--dirChange',
          '/tmp',
          '--checkfile',
          '<i>pwd_path</i>/required_file',
          '--Verbose',
          '--RunIfTrue',
          '<i>pwd_path</i>/is5minloadok.sh',
          '--DonePostRun',
          'touch /tmp/test6_doneok',
          '--ErrorPostRun',
          'touch /tmp/test6_error'
        ];
</pre>

Will execute JobRunner jobs 

Where:
  --help       This help message
  --version    Version information
  --JobRunner  Location of executable tool (if not in PATH, will also look for it tool dir)
  --quiet      Do not print stdout/stderr data from system calls
  --endSetReport  At the end of a set, print a report of job status (bypassing successfully completed jobs) ('level' 1 is to not print 'already in progress' jobs, use a 'level' of 2 to add those, and level '3' to add successfully completed jobs)
  --SleepInBetweenJobs  Specify the number of seconds to sleep in between two consecutive jobs (example: when a job check the system load before running using JobRunner's '--RunIfTrue', this allow the load to drop some) (default is not to sleep)
  --watchdir   Directory to look for configuration files [*]
  --maxSet     Specify the maximum number of set to to in 'watchdir' mode (default is to continue without end)
  --sleep      Specify the sleep time in between sets (default: 60)
  --retryall   When running a different set, retry all previously completed entries (especially useful when when a JobRunner configuration uses '--badErase' or '--RunIfTrue')
  --DirOnceBefore    Directory to look for configuration files only once (before '--watchdir')
  --dironce    Directory to look for configuration files only once (after '--watchdir')
  --timeSort   Run jobs in configuration files' Access Time, Creation Time, Modification Time order, instead of the order they are provided. Valid values: atime ctime mtime
  --RandomOrder  Run jobs in random order instead of the order they are provided (can help with multiple lock dir access over NFS if the data is not propagated from server yet) (note: if providing a random seed --which must be over 0-- use different values for multiple JobRunner_Caller, or simply do not provide any and the current 'time' value will be used)
  --okquit     The default is to exit with the error status if the "done" vs "todo" count is not the same, this bypass this behavior and exit with the ok status
  --ExtraLockingTool  Specify the full path location of a special locking tool used to create a mutual exclusion for a JobID execution (**)
  --LockingToolLockDir  Directory in which the ExtraLockingTool lock for JobID will be created
  --QuitFile   Location of a file that will be created by the tool and used to let it know to stop processing if the file has disappeared (default is to use a random file location, that will be displayed at the beginning of each set)


*: in this mode, the program will complete a full run then on the files found in this directory, then sleep '--sleep' seconds before re-reading the directory content and see if any new configuration file is present, before running it. The program will never stop, it is left to the user to stop the program.

**: this is extremely important for queues on network shares (such as NFS), specify the tool that is know to create a safe exclusive access lock file on such a network share. The tool (or wrapper script) must: 1) take only one argument, the lock file location. 2) create the lock file but not erase it (this is done by JobRunner_Caller after job completion). 3) return the 0 exit status if the lock was obtained, any other status otherwise.


Job Processing Order: Unless '--RandomOrder' or '--ctimeSort' are used, jobs are processed in the following order: first the '--DirOnceBefore' configuration files, then the '--watchdir' configuration files, followed by the '--dironce' ones, finally the command lines ones. Then, if the tool is in '--watchdir' mode, it will do an infinite number of passes on those files (unless '--maxSet' runs if used)

WARNING: the tool is designed to pass any 'ctrl+C' keyboard input to the 'JobRunner' tool. To end a 'JobRunner_Caller' in '--watchdir' mode (before any '--maxSet' completion if set) it is recommend to use the 'kill' or 'killall' commands, or to 'ctrl+z' and then 'kill' the "suspended" job (or to kill it during its "sleep" times)
</pre>

<code>JobRunner_Caller</code>'s purpose is to execute <i>JobRunner</i> on its <i>configuration files</i>. The entire decision on wether a job is to be run is done by <i>JobRunner</i> itself.

<h3>Processing order</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create the <code>quitfile</code>
  <li>Set <i>KeepDoingIt</i> to <i>true</i> if <code>watchdir</code> is used, <i>false</i> otherwise
  <li>Run a <i>Set</i>:
  <ul>
    <li>Generate a <i>ToBeDone</i> list by adding to it:
    <ol>
      <li>Entries found in the <code>DirOnceBefore</code> directory (only first <i>set</i>) 
      <li>Entries found in the <code>watchdir</code> directory
      <li>Entries found in the <code>dironce</code> directory (only first <i>set</i>)
      <li>Command line provided <i>JobRunner configuration files</i> 
    </ol>
    <li>If <code>RandomOrder</code> or <code>timeSort</code> is used, apply it to the <i>ToBeDone</i> list
    <li>For each <i>Job</i> in <i>ToBeDone</i>:
    <ul>
      <li>Check if the <code>QuitFile</code> still exists; if it does not, set <i>KeepDoingIt</i> to <i>false</i> and exit loop
      <li><b>Run <i>Job</i> using <i>JobRunner</i></b>
    </ul>
    <li>If used, decrease <code>maxSet</code>. If <i>0</i>, turn <i>KeepDoingIt</i> to <i>false</i> 
  </ul>
  <li>If <i>KeepDoingIt</i> is set to <i>true</i>, run the next <i>Set</i>
</ul>
    
<h3>Examples of use</h3>

<h4>Running a set of jobs</h4>

In its simplest use, the tool is designed to run <i>JobRunner</i> configuration files. For example, the <code>test6.jobrunner</code>, <code>test8.jobrunner</code> and <code>test9.jobrunner</code> jobs created earlier:

<pre>
% JobRunner_Caller test6.jobrunner test8.jobrunner test9.jobrunner
Reminder: to quit properly after a Job/during a Set, delete the 'QuitFile': <i>/tmpdir</i>/Gv6LCnydsw


[**] Job Runner Config: '/Users/martial/Works/JobRunner/test6.jobrunner'
  @@ Can be skipped
(stdout)[Warning] [JobRunner] test6 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test6 : Previously successfully completed, and no file listed in 'checkfile' is newer than the logfile, not re-runing


[**] Job Runner Config: './test8.jobrunner'
  ++ Job completed
(stdout)[Warning] [JobRunner] test8 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test8 : == 'RunIfTrue' check OK (/Users/martial/Works/JobRunner/is5minloadok.sh)
[JobRunner] test8 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test8 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test8 : %% OK Post Running: 'touch /tmp/test6_doneok'

[JobRunner] test8 : Job successfully completed


[**] Job Runner Config: './test9.jobrunner'
  ++ Job completed
(stdout)[Warning] [JobRunner] test9 : dirChange -- Current directory changed to '/tmp'
[JobRunner] test9 : == 'RunIfTrue' check OK (/Users/martial/Works/JobRunner/is5minloadok.sh)
[JobRunner] test9 : %% In progress: 

[JobRunner] test9 : ++ Creating "In Progress" lock dir
[JobRunner] test9 : %% OK Post Running: 'touch /tmp/test6_doneok'

[JobRunner] test9 : Job successfully completed


%%%%%%%%%% Set 1 run results: 3 / 3 %%%%%%%%%%
Done (3 / 3)
</pre>

As can be seen, <code>test6.jobrunner</code> was already run in the past, but <code>test8.jobrunner</code> and <code>test9.jobrunner</code> were not yet, so <i>JobRunner_Caller</i> just insured that those were called in the order they were entered on the command line.

<h4>Queue modes</h4>

When using a <code>watchdir</code> the tool will never exit, unless deletetion of the <code>quitfile</code>; this mode is used to run a <i>queue processor</i>:

<pre>
% JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir
</pre>

One <code>JobRunner_Caller</code> equals to one <i>queue processor</i>. To have multiple of those run as many <code>JobRunner_Caller</code> as you want <i>queue processor</i> per <i>system</i>. For example to run three <i>queue processors</i> on a system called <i>linux1</i>, in multiple shells:
<pre>
linux1:shell1 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir
linux1:shell2 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir
linux1:shell3 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir
</pre>

It is therefore possible to run a set number of <i>queue processors</i> on a limitless number of systems as long as they share the <code>watchdir</code> and <i>JobRunner</i>'s <code>lockdir</code> directories. For example, to run one <i>queue processor</i> on the <i>linux1</i> and two on the <i>linux2</i> system:
<pre>
linux1:shell1 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir

linux2:shell1 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir
linux2:shell2 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir watchdir_dir
</pre>
When doing so it is often important to keep in mind that the directory sharing often does not insure mutual exclusion of the lock directory creation, and it might be important to use the <code>ExtraLockingTool</code> and <code>LockingToolLockDir</code> command line options.

Running the tool on a non-homogenous set of system is also possible; given that the <i>job selection</i> process is done using the <i>jobid</i>, it is possible to create a set of <i>JobRunner configuration files</i> that are specific to a given operating system, in order to optimize processing time. For example to run one queue on a linux system, and one queue on a Mac OSX system:
<pre>
linux1:shell1 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir anyOSjobs_dir --watchdir linuxOnly_dir

osx1:shell1 % JobRunner_Caller --watchdir anyOSjobs_dir --watchdir OSXOnly_dir
</pre>
The <i>linux1</i> system will try to process jobs that are both in <code>anyOSjobs_dir</code> and <code>linuxOnly_dir</code>, while the <i>osx1</i>  system will try to process jobs that are both in <code>anyOSjobs_dir</code> and <code>OSXOnly_dir</code>. So if a <i>jobid</i> <code>complexJob99.jobrunner</i> is present both in <code>linuxOnly_dir</code> and <code>OSXOnly_dir</code> in its <i>linux</i> and <i>OSX</i> executable equivalents, the first system to be available will complete that <i>job</i> and the other system will see that the <i>jobid</i> is used in <i>JobRunner</i>'s <code>lockdir</code> already, and will skip it from being reprocessed.
In this example, a <code>anyOSjobs_dir</code> is also used to contain any <i>job</i> that can be run on either operating system.
